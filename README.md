# AsphaltPavementType-MiniRocket
The data used in this project is from [time series classification](https://timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=AsphaltPavementType). This data is first used for a [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197618301349) published in 2018, which is before Rocket and MiniRocket were introduced. Now, I want to try applying MiniRocket for the same dataset.

The input dataset is a univariate time series, and the length of each observation varies. There are three labels, which are cobblestone street, dirt street, and flexible pavement street.
